## Understanding the P-value and more statistical concepts

- We use the ***p-value*** to determine whether we should reject o fail to
  reject the null hypothesis.
- The ***alpha value (α)*** is the probability of rejecting a null hypothesis
  that is true.
- The ***confidence level*** is how sure we are the confidence interval
  contains the true the population parameter value. This confidence level
  equals 1-α.
